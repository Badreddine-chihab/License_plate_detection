         image classification for 16 classes using Yolov8

In general , i wrote a script that from a video that take frames of unique license plates and crop the license plate to be saved in directory crop_img, from input images we go thrpugh all the images in the folder and apply the model to save results in crop_img
Next , for the second model , we take as inputs the crop_img folder to apply charcater segemntation for each plate and detect if it is one the 16 classes.
As outputs , we plot the result images in a grid using matplotlib.pyplot , print the result in the console using character mapping to transform arabic characters back to its original form. Furthermore, the results images are also saved in results Directory .
